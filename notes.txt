conda activate ollama

------

The command you provided will start the container in detached mode, but it doesn't include options for stopping and restarting the container. To manage the container more effectively, you can use the following commands:

1. **Start the container:**
   ```sh
   docker start ollama
   ```

2. **Stop the container:**
   ```sh
   docker stop ollama
   ```

3. **Run the container (initial command):**
   ```sh
   docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
   ```

With these commands, you can start and stop the container as needed. Let me know if you need any more help!

1. **Enter the container:**
   ```sh
   docker exec -it ollama /bin/bash
   ```

2. **Clone the GitHub repository:**
   Inside the container, use `git` to clone your repository. For example:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   Assuming your repository has a `requirements.txt` file, install the packages using `pip`:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   Start your Streamlit app with the following command:
   ```sh
   streamlit run your_app.py
   ```

These steps will ensure that all changes are made inside the container and will persist even after you exit. Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands:

```sh
# Enter the container
docker exec -it ollama /bin/bash

# Inside the container
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run your_app.py
```

To ensure that the Streamlit app is accessible from any IP address, you should bind the Streamlit server to `0.0.0.0`. This allows the app to be accessed from outside the container.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Run the container with the updated command:**
   ```sh
   docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 -p 8501:8501 --name ollama ollama/ollama
   ```

2. **Enter the container:**
   ```sh
   docker exec -it ollama /bin/bash
   ```

3. **Clone the GitHub repository and install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app with the `--server.address` option:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run your_app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0
   ```

By binding the Streamlit server to `0.0.0.0`, you ensure that it listens on all network interfaces, making it accessible from your host machine at `http://localhost:8501`.
